/**
 * Entity representing a master definition for a specific type of construction.
 *
 * Examples include: House, Building, Bridge, Lake, Gym, etc.
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - Each construction type defines a typical duration and required materials.
 * - Unique constraint on the 'name' column prevents duplication.
 * - The relationship with ConstructionTypeMaterial is one-to-many but does NOT
 *   use cascade or orphan removal to avoid unintended deletions.
 * - Deletion of a ConstructionType is restricted if it is referenced by
 *   any ConstructionTypeMaterial, ConstructionOrder, or Snapshot.
 * - createdAt is used for audit purposes to know when the record was first created.
